## 📝 Project Description

This project explores how major FMCG brands are analysed, evaluated, and strategically managed behind the scenes. Working with a large dataset of product information, pack sizes, volumes, COGS, and net sales, I built a full business case by calculating KPIs, visualizing insights, and applying commercial logic to identify growth opportunities.

The progression follows the three pillars of the case-study structure:

---

## 1️⃣ Fast-Moving Consumer Goods Analysis

In the first stage, I worked as a **Category Manager** for Healthmax and performed a full category review of the shampoo market.

### **What I did**
- Cleaned and structured a large internal dataset  
- Calculated core FMCG KPIs:
  - Market share  
  - YTD (Year-to-Date) performance  
  - MAT (Moving Annual Total)  
  - Category value & volume growth  
- Created PivotTables to analyse performance by:
  - Brand  
  - Pack size  
  - Subcategory  
  - Year & month  
- Built visuals to identify:
  - Volume drivers  
  - Category shifts  
  - Brand performance gaps

This created the foundation for understanding Healthmax’s strengths and weaknesses within the category.

## 2️⃣ Net Revenue Management (NRM)  
**Focus Areas: Brand Portfolio Pricing & Mix Management**

In this part, I applied NRM principles to understand how pricing, assortment, and profitability influence net revenue.

### **What I did**
- Calculated:
  - Net price (Net Sales ÷ Volume)  
  - Gross profit per unit  
  - Gross margin %  
  - Net sales contribution per SKU  
- Built a **Price Ladder** to evaluate pack-price architecture  
- Identified pricing gaps and opportunities using Portfolio Pricing frameworks  
- Modelled the launch of a new SKU using Mix Management:
  - Expected volume  
  - Incremental category growth  
  - Margin contribution  
  - Price-positioning logic  

This allowed me to determine where Healthmax could profitably expand and optimize its offering.

## 3️⃣ Optimizing Net Revenue  
**Focus Areas: Trade Terms, Pack Price Architecture, Promotion Management**

The final stage consisted of applying the remaining pillars of NRM to shape a complete commercial strategy.

### **What I did**
- Conducted **Trade Terms Management** analysis:
  - Identified where customer investments drive profitable growth  
  - Highlighted low-margin or non-strategic partners  
- Built a **Pack Price Architecture (PPA)** strategy for small pack sizes  
- Evaluated past promotions via:
  - Baseline vs. incremental volume  
  - Lift analysis  
  - ROI assessment  
- Forecasted next year’s revenue based on:
  - Expected organic market growth  
  - Incremental revenues from new NRM initiatives  
  - Portfolio changes and pricing shifts  

This resulted in a full forward-looking business case grounded in both volume and margin logic.
